Ciabatta
=====================

.. ingredients::

   - 500 g AP flour
   - 375 g water
   - 10 g salt
   - 5 g yeast

.. procedure::

   For the biga: mix 400 g of flour, 272 g water and 1 g yeast.
   Mix and let rest for 14-16 hours (until plump, gassy and sour).

   Mix the rest of the ingredients (100 g flour and 103 g water, 10 g salt, 1 g yeast), mix to incorporate.
   Add the biga, mix, fold  few times and let rise until slightly more than doubled (about 2 hours).
   Flop the dough on a floured surface.
   Let proof covered with a cloth for 1-2 hours.
   With a bench scraper, cut elongated rectangles, invert them in flour and place
   them on a baking tray.

   Preheat the oven preheated to 230C, and place a container of water inside it.
   Place the tray in the oven, cook for 20 minutes or so. Take the water container out
   at about half way. Turn off the oven, leave the ciabatta inside with the door cracked open.
