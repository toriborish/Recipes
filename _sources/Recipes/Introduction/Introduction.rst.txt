Introduction
===============

What is this?
-------------
This is a collection of recipes I cook reasonably regularly.
Some recipes act as placeholders and just contain links to recipes I liked.
At some point the recipe will actually be typed out.

The source is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/carlogico/Recipes>`_,
and is built automatically [using GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/main.yml) and hosted by GitHub Pages.
You can build locally using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_.
Feel free to fork the project or open pull requests.

The whole project is comprised of `.rst` files (`primer on rst syntax <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_).
Images are tracked using `git-lfs <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_.

Why?
----

Because.

Units of measurements
------------------------

The collection tries to use SI units, however, if the measurement is not crucial
(eg if it won't matter too much if you miss the amount by 30% or if the quantity is best estimated by the cook)
cups and tablespoons can be used.
