.. makes:: 1 9x13 inch pan worth

.. ingredients::

    For the meat sauce:

    - 1 medium chopped onion
    - 2 cloves mashed garlic (?)
    - 1 lb. ground lamb
    - 1 lb. ground beef
    - 2.5 cups tomato puree (can use tomato sauce instead and cook longer)
    - 1/2 tsp dried oregano
    - 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
    - 1/4 tsp pepper

    For the white sauce:

    - 2 cups milk
    - 6 Tbsp flour
    - ~4 Tbsp butter/olive oil
    - salt/pepper/garlic powder to taste

    Other:

    - Parmesan cheese
    - 1 lb. grated mozarella
    - 1 lb. penne

.. procedure::

    Sautee the onion in olive oil for a few minutes. Add in garlic. Add the lamb and beef and cook until all meat is fully cooked.
    Drain fat. Add tomatoe puree, oregano, pepper, cinnamon and any other desired spires and simmer for 15 minutes.
    Meanwhile, make white sauce. Start with a roux of flour and butter (can substitute a little of it with olive oil). Add in seasonings.
    Slowly add in milk, checking consistency as you go (you may not need all of the milk).
    Cook pasta.
    Put together in a 13 x 9 in baking pan. There should be 2 completely layers of pasta, a little parmesan, white sauce, red sauce, and mozarella.
    Bake for 35-40 minutes, covering with aluminum foil at the start so the cheese doesn't burn.

.. note::

    This is a family recipe of Tori's. We have a hard copy of the recipe, but I'm not sure where it's from.
