Pasta alla Zozzona
==================

.. ingredients::

   - 300 g rigatoni (or whatever short pasta strikes your fancy)
   - 150 g guanciale
   - 200 g sausage
   - 1 onion
   - 1.5-2 cups tomato sauce (blitzed canned whole peeled tomatoes)
   - 3 egg yolks
   - 1/2 cup grated pecorino

.. procedure::

   Cut the guanciale into `2 x 4 x .4` cm cuboids and take the sausage meat out of the casing.
   Warm a skillet with some olive oil on medium heat. Slice the onion very thinly and add it to the skillet.
   Once the onion is tranlucent and slightly golden, add the guanciale and the sausage meat.
   Increse the heat to medium high. Once the sausage meat has changed color and is almost cooked through,
   add the tomato sauce. Cook on medium low for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce dries up a bit.
   Drop the pasta into a pot of boiling salted water.
   In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the finely grated cheese until you get a creamy mixture
   (add a tsp of the cooking water to make it slightly easier to mix).
   One minute before the pasta is *al dente*, drain it and add it to the sauce, reserving some of the cooking water.
   Cook the pasta in the sauce on medium heat for the remaining minute, adding enough cooking water
   to make the sauce less dry.
   Turn off the stove, and incorporate the egg mixture into the pasta. Serve and eat.

.. note::

   Didn't have pecorino, so I ended up using parmigiano and it was pretty good.
   Also added 1 dried chili.

   This is definitely a dish that very explicitly tries to murder you
   (a bit like :doc:`Pasta_PastaAlFume`), but it's really delicious.
