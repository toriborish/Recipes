Bryan's Curry
=============

.. ingredients::

   - 2 onions, diced
   - oil or butter
   - 4 cloves garlic
   - 3cm block ginger
   - curry powder
   - black pepper to taste
   - salt
   - paprika
   - cayenne
   - 500 g of any kind of solid vegetable, meat cubes, paneer or tofu
   - 1/2 can of tomato sauce
   - 100 g ground cashews
   - 100 g yogurt

.. procedure::

   Sautee onions in butter or oil. When translucent, add garlic ginger paste. Cook 1-2 minutes.
   Add spice mixture, cook until fragrant. Add paneer cubes.
   (If meat, maybe you should have browned it first, if tofu, simmer it in salted water for a few minutes).
   Cook 3 minutes, until everything is coated in spices. Add tomato sauce. Cook until the protein is almost ready.
   Add a bit of water/stock if too thick. Add cashews and yogurt. Cook 3-5 minutes more.

.. note::

	Tried this with paneer, tofu, potatoes, chickpeas. Anything seems to work ok.
	Substituted the ground cashews with ground almonds and almond flour, also seems to work.
