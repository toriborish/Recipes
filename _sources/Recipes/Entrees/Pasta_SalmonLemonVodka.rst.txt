Pasta al Salmone
=====================

.. ingredients::

   - short pasta
   - smoked salmon
   - lemon
   - vodka
   - butter

.. procedure::

   while pasta is cooking, take about half a cup of cooking liquid and pour in a skillet.
   Make it boil. Add a little bit of cold butter (30 grams or so) and mix until it emulsifies.
   You can use more water and butter if you want more sauce. Add juice of 1 big lemon (and zest if you like lemon).
   About 1 minute before the pasta is cooked, drain and reserve some water just in case. Add the pasta to the skillet, cook 1 minute.
   Add the salmon and a little bit of vodka (say 3 tbsp). Quickly mix until the salmon is barely cooked.
   Plate, add more salmon bites on top and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper
