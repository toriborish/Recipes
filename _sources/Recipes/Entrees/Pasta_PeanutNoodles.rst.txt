Peanut Noodles
=====================

.. ingredients::

   Sauce:

   - 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
   - 1/4 cup soy sauce
   - 3 tbsp sesame oil
   - 2 tbsp vegetable oil (I always substitute with either sesame oil or chili oil)
   - at least a tablespoon of grated ginger (I use a microplane)
   - at least 6 gloves of garlic, pressed
   - optional: crushed red pepper flakes (if not using chili oil)

   Other:

   - 1 pound pasta (or however much you want at a given time)
   - scallions or green onions or something similar for garnishing

.. procedure::

   Combine all the sauce ingredients, adjusting amounts to taste.
   Cook and strain pasta.
   Pour sauce over pasta and mix.  I prefer the sauce not cooked, so I sometimes keep a little extra to add after the initial mixing since it cooks a little when added to hot pasta in a hot pot.

This recipe comes from Talia.

.. note::

   This proportions can be altered to taste.  I usually make the recipe to use for one meal and then freeze the rest, so I only cook however much pasta I want on a given day.  Even when frozen, the sauce is still soft enough to scoop some of it out.
