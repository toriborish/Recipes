Pork Rillettes
=====================

.. ingredients::

   - 1 kg pork shoulder, cut into chunks
   - 2 cloves garlic
   - sprig rosemary
   - a couple bay leaves
   - zest of half of a lemon
   - 2 cups of some kind of stock
   - salt and pepper to taste

.. procedure::

   The day before, salt the pork and rest uncovered in fridge.
   Brown pork in a dutch oven. Add the rest of the ingredients, put in a 275 F oven for 2.5-3 hours.
   Take out the cooked pork (should be very tender and almost fall apart). Shred the pork.
   Continue reducing the liquid. Once reduced, add some of the liquid and fat to the shredded pork.
   Salt and pepper to taste. Pack tightly in a jar (small ones are better). Top with some of the fat.
   Store in fridge for up to a week.

.. note::

   The lemon zest was great! Didn't end up using all the liquid, the remaining stock was
   very dense and flavorful. More, smaller jars rather than a single big one would have been better.
