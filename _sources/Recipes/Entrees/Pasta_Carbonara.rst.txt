Pasta alla Carbonara
====================

This makes enough for 3 (skinny) or 2 (hungry) people.

.. ingredients::

   - 300 g pasta (spaghetti is traditional, I kind of like short pasta)
   - 200/250 g guanciale
   - 3 egg yolks
   - 3/4 cup grated pecorino
   - freshly ground black pepper

.. procedure::

   Start a pot of salted water on medium high heat.
   Cut the pancetta very thin (.3 cm) slices, then make 5 x 3 cm rectangles.
   Put the guanciale in a skillet, slowly warm it up to medium heat.
   Put the egg yolks in a large bowl (it will need to hold all your pasta eventually), and start whisking them.
   Once the guanciale has released a good amount of fat, pour the fat in a separate container.
   Once the fat cools down a little, slowly stream it into the yolks while whisking (like making a mayonnaise).
   Repeat this operation a few times (until the guanciale gets slightly browned, but not all the way to crunchy,
   then move the skillet off the stove).
   Drop the pasta in the pot of boiling water.

   Two minutes before the pasta is *al dente*, add the grated pecorino and black pepper to the yolk mixture.
   Turn the skillet to high heat.
   One minute before the pasta is *al dente*, reserve some water.
   Drain the pasta and add it to the skillet with guanciale and a spoonful of cooking water. Reserve some water.
   Sautee for a minute or so, adding water if it looks very dry.
   Dump the whole thing in the bowl with the yolk mixture, mix, and add some cooking water as needed
   (the sauce should quickly become smooth and silky).

   Serve with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.

.. warning::

   This is not a completely traditional carbonara recipe. Still delicious!

   At least it doesn't commit crimes against humanity (cream or garlic).
