Tagliatelle al Ragù di Funghi e Salsiccia
===========================================

.. ingredients::

   - 300 g fresh tagliatelle (see :doc:`Pasta_PastaAllUovo`)
   - 1 cup dried porcini mushrooms
   - 200 g sausage (see :doc:`Pork_Salsicce`)
   - 1 onion
   - 1.5-2 cups tomato sauce (blitzed canned whole peeled tomatoes)
   - 1/2 cup dry white wine
   - 1 cup chicken stock
   - 1 bay leaf

.. procedure::

   Let the dried porcini soak in very warm water for at least 15 minutes.
   Warm up a sautee pan on medium heat with 1-2 tbsp of olive oil.
   Thinly slice the onion and add it to the pan. Sautee the onion until translucent and lightly golden.
   Sprinkle a pinch of salt mid way.
   Take the sausage meat out of the casing and add it to the pan. Once it has turned color and is almost cooked through, take the porcini
   out of the water, squeeze them, very roughly chop them and add them to the pan.
   Turn the heat to medium high, and after 3-5 minutes deglaze with the white wine.
   Add the chicken stock, and between 1/2 and 1 cup of the water the porcini were sitting in.
   Once it starts lightly boiling, add the tomato sauce and the bay leaf.
   After 5 minutes, turn the stove to low, and let simmer until it reaches a thick, creamy consistency
   (maybe about 30 minutes?).
   Drop the pasta into a pot of boiling salted water. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking liquid,
   drain when just shy of *al dente*. Add to the pan with the sauce and cook over medium heat for a couple of minutes,
   adding cooking water as necessary.

.. note::

   Very delicious.
