Pad Thai
========

.. makes:: 2 large portions

.. ingredients::

   For the sauce:

   - 3 tbsp fish sauce
   - 3 tbsp brown sugar
   - 3 tbsp white vinegar (substitution for tamarind juice)
   - 1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce
   - 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce
   - 1 tsp paprika

   For the stir fry:

   - 200 g rice noodles
   - 4 cloves garlic
   - 1/2 inch ginger
   - 3 green onions
   - 2 eggs
   - whatever protein
   - whatever vegetables
   - some bean sprouts
   - 1/4 cup chopped peanuts
   - 1/6 cup chopped cilantro
   - 1 lime

.. procedure::

   This makes two portions, and given the size of my skillet, I separate the ingredients into two portions and cook them separately.
   Mix the ingredients for the sauce.
   Prepare all the vegetables and protein (finely chop garlic and ginger, slice green onions in big pieces, separating white and green, cut vegetables and protein pretty this so they cook quickly).
   Whisk the eggs.
   Once all the ingredients are ready, cook the protein on high heat.
   I also cook the vegetables about half way through since my stove isn't too powerful.
   Clean the skillet/wok, and on high heat add oil, ginger, garlic and the white part of the green onion.
   Once those get to a golden color, add the egg. Let it set for a 10-20 seconds and then scramble it roughly.
   If you didn't cook the vegetables earlier, add them and cook for a minute or so. If not, add them with the protein.
   Add the protein.
   Add the noodles, and drizzle in the sauce. Make sure everything is coated, and cook until the noodles are ready.
   Add a little bit of water if it looks too dry. Just before the end, add the bean sprouts and the green part of the green onions.
   Cook for 10 seconds and serve with the chopped peanuts, the cilantro and a wedge of lime.
