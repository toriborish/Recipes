Pasta al Pat√© di Olive
===========================================

.. makes:: 2 to 3 servings

.. ingredients::

   - pasta
   - 200 g kalamata olives
   - 6 cloves of garlic
   - parmigiano
   - olive oil

.. procedure::

   With a mezzaluna knife (or whatever really), chop the garlic and olives until they form
   a very fine paste.
   Put a few generous spoonfuls of olive paste, a couple tbsp of olive oil and a small mound of
   grated parmigiano in each plate. Cook the pasta until al dente, drain, add it to the plates.
   Mix. Eat.

.. note::

   Yes, chopping the stuff is time consuming and annoying, but the effort will make everything taste better.
   You can use a blender, just don't tell me.

   This is very garlic-y, feel free to chage the amount of garlic to your taste. More is better.
