Peperonata
=====================

   - 6 peppers (various colors!)
   - 2 red onions
   - 2 cloves of garlic
   - tiny rosemary sprig
   - 1-2 cups tomato sauce (can be passata, canned tomatoes, grated and cooked fresh tomatoes...)

   Put the two garlic cloves (smashed) in a pot with 1-2 tablespoons to oil.
   Heat to medium heat, add the onions (sliced into medium julienne), cook until translucent.
   Add a pinch of salt. Add the peppers (sliced into batonnets). Cook uncovered for 5 minutes.
   Put a lid on the pot and cook until (the peppers are soft) - 5 minutes.
