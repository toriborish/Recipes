Pasta al Tonno e Pomodoro
=========================

.. ingredients::

   - 300 g pasta (I like short pasta for this)
   - 300-400 g tomato passata (or tomato sauce)
   - 2 can of oil-packed tuna
   - 1.5 yellow or red onions
   - 2 tbsp olive oil
   - salt
   - a couple of dried chilis (or any kind scoville-increaser of your choice)

.. procedure::

   Get a pot of salted water on a medium high heat.
   In a skillet, sautee the onions (sliced, but not paper thin) for 5-10 minutes until they start to turn golden.
   Add the tuna (feel free to discard the oil that comes in the can), break it in 1-2 cm chunks with the back of a wooden spoon.
   Continue sauteeing for 3-5 more minutes on medium high heat. Stir often to avoid tuna explosions.
   Add the dried chilis, cook one more minute and add the tomto passata.

   Drop the pasta in the pot of boiling salted water
   (this assumes it will cook in about 10 minutes,
   if it has a faster cooking time make sure to cook the sauce for at least 5 minutes).
   When it is 2 minutes shy of *al dente*, drain reserving a cup of cooking water.
   Stir the pasta in the sauce, continue cooking on high heat for two minutes,
   adding some of the cooking water if it looks too dry.

.. note::

   Kalamata olives make a great addition to the sauce (to be added after the tuna),
   unfortunately Tori doesn't like them...
