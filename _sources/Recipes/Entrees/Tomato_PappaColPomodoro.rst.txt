Pappa col Pomodoro
=====================

.. ingredients::

   - about 2 cups tomato sauce (can be passata, canned tomatoes, grated and cooked fresh tomatoes...)
   - 200-300 g stale bread
   - 1 red onion
   - 2 cloves of garlic
   - either a few basil leaves or a tiny rosemary sprig

.. procedure::

   Slice the bread into thin slices, dry in the oven (300F?).
   Slice the onion into thick (3mm slices). Smash the garlic in its peel.
   Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a pot on medium-low heat. Add onion and garlic, sprinkle a pinch of salt.
   The onion just needs to turn translucent and sweat, not brown.
   Add the tomato sauce, continue cooking for 5 minutes or so.
   Put the bread slices on top of the tomato. Cook covered for a few minutes.
   If necessary add a bit of water. Cook for 15 minutes on medium heat. After the first 5 minutes,
   break down the bread and mix. Discared the garlic cloves.
   Once cooked, break down the bread completely with a whisk. Rest for 5 minutes.
   Add the herbs. Whisk in a generous amount of oil. Serve.
