Pasta al Porro e Salsiccia
===========================

.. ingredients::

   - 200 g pasta
   - 2 big leeks
   - 150-200 g sausage (see :doc:`Pork_Salsicce`)
   - 2/3 cup dry white wine
   - generous amount of freshly ground black pepper

.. procedure::

   Slice the leeks into very thin rounds (stop after the light green part) and wash them thoroughly.
   Add 2 tbsp of olive oil to a skillet, and turn the heat to medium high.
   Take the sausage meat out of the casing, and add it in small chunks to the skillet.
   Cook until lightly browned. Add the sliced leeks to the skillet, and cook
   until they turn translucent and lightly golden. Deglaze with the wine.
   In the meantime, drop the pasta into a pot of boiling salted water. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking liquid,
   drain a couple of minutes shy of *al dente*. Add to the pan with the sauce and cook over medium heat for a couple of minutes,
   adding cooking water as necessary. Top with freshly ground black pepper.
