Chicken Chile Verde
=====================

.. makes:: 4 servings

.. ingredients::

   - some amount of meat (I used 2 chicken legs + 1 breast)
   - 15 tomatillos
   - 1 onion
   - jalapeño pepper
   - 2 poblano peppers
   - 3 serrano peppers (adjust to your favourite spice level)
   - 1 tomato (optional)
   - 1 tbsp cumin (possibly ground)
   - 1 tsp salt

.. procedure::

   Put the meat in a pressure cooker.
   Roughly chop all vegetables to 3-5 cm pieces, add them to the pressure cooker as well.
   Add a tsp of salt and the cumin, make sure to mix stuff well.
   Close the pressure cooker and put it on medium high heat.
   After 15-20 minutes after it has reached full pressure, take it off the stove.
   Take out the meat and reserve it. Blend all the rest. Add salt if necessary.
   Put the meat back in, shred it if you like. Eat.

.. note::

   I think pretty much any kind of meat would be ok, probably cubes of pork shoulder might be best.
