Galette with Onions
=====================

.. ingredients::

   For the crust (makes 2):

   - 450 g AP flour
   - 300 g frozen butter
   - 150 g cold water
   - 5 g salt

   For the filling:

   - 3 Onions
   - 2 tbsp olive oil
   - 1 tbsp butter
   - a bunch of green onion and/or scallions and/or one leek
   - 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
   - copious amount of Comte

.. procedure::

   For the crust:

   Cube the frozen butter into 3cm cubes. Add flour, salt and butter to a food processor.
   Process until the biggest butter chunk is about 1cm.
   Start rolling it on your work surface until the butter chunks are flattened out a bit.
   Add the water gradually, folding the dough onto itself and rolling it until it comes together.
   Divide in two, wrap in plastic wrap (make sure to roll the wrapped dough so that it fill the plastic).
   Chill for 30 minutes before rolling out (or freeze until needed).

   For the filling:

   Sautee the thinly sliced onions in a skillet with the oil and butter. They should be golden,
   but not yet caramelized. Set aside, and in the same skillet sautee quickly the green onions,
   thinly sliced lengthwise.

   Roll out the dough to 3mm thick. Spread the mustard up to 5cm-ish to the edges.
   Cover with the sauteed onions. Grate the cheese to cover the onions.
   Top with the green onions.
   Fold the edges to overlap on top of the onions for a few cm.

   Bake at 375 F for about 40 minutes.

.. note::

   We tried both Comte and Gruyere and preferred Comte.
   I think i would have liked to eggwash the exposed dough.
