Lemon Ricotta Pancakes
=======================

.. makes:: breakfast for Tori and Carlo

.. ingredients::

   - 102 grams all-purpose flour
   - 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
   - pinch salt
   - 50 grams granulated sugar
   - zest of 1 lemon
   - 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
   - 3 eggs
   - 170 grams ricotta
   - 60 grams milk
   - generous squeeze of juice (maybe juice from ~1/4 lemon)
   - 28 grams melted butter

.. procedure::

   In a small bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt.
   Begin heating a skillet (cast-iron works well) over medium or medium-low heat.
   In a large bowl, add the sugar and lemon zest. Gently rub the zest into the sugar with your fingers.
   Add the vanilla to the sugar/zest and mix.
   Add the eggs and whisk well (until foamy).
   Melt the butter. I always do it on the skillet so that effectively butters it before the first batch, but feel free to melt the butter separately too.
   Add the ricotta, milk, lemon juice, and butter to the egg/sugar mixture. Whisk well.
   Add the flour and gently whisk.
   Cook the pancakes.

.. note::

   I usually wait until I've made a recipe several times to add it to this recipe book, but these were so good the first time I made them that both Carlo and I agreed they should be in here.
   So I haven't experimented too much with this recipe yet. The main thing I did was add regular milk and lemon juice instead of buttermilk (which is the variation I wrote here). I'm sure buttermilk would work too, but we didn't have any, and I liked the idea of adding some lemon juice.
   I still want to see if I can replace the ricotta with something I more commonly have at home, so I will update this recipe as I experiment if I find variations I like better.
