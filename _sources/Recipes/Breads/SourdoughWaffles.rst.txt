Sourdough Waffles
=====================

.. ingredients::

   For the overnight sponge:

   - 227 g discarded starter
   - 241 g AP flour
   - 454 g buttermilk (or regular milk)
   - 20 g sugar

   For the rest of the batter:

   - Overnight sponge (see above)
   - 2 eggs
   - 50 g vegetable oil
   - 1 tsp baking soda

.. procedure::

   The night before you want to make waffles, combine the discarded starter, flour, buttermilk (or regular milk - see note below), and sugar in a large bowl.  Cover and leave out overnight.
   The next morning, add the eggs, vegetable oil, and baking soda to the batter and mix well.
   Make waffles!

.. note::

   This is our favorite waffle recipe!  They're best when made into Belgian (thicker) waffles.
   I rarely keep the exact ratio of discarded starter to the rest of the ingredints the same (since it depends on exactly how much discard there is).  The recipe seems pretty robust to any somewhat similar ratio to that listed above.
   Although the recipe calls for buttermilk, I also rarely have buttermilk at home, so I usually just use normal skim milk.  If I have an open lemon or lime, I add a little bit of lemon/lime juice to it as a substitute as well.  These are delicious when topped with whipped cream and maple syrup (and berries or bananas for Tori).
