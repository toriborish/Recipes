Cookie dough ice cream bar
============================

.. makes:: around 7 bars

.. ingredients::

   - ice cream (see, for example :doc:`Gelato_Crema`)
   - 15+ oz chocolate (I used ~60% Valhrona solid chocolate in small pieces)
   - 1/2 recipe cookie dough (see :doc:`../Desserts/ChocolateChipCookies`)
   - (Optional: almond slices)

.. procedure::

   Make cookie dough. Cut/tear into small pieces (however big you want in your bars) and freeze.
   Make ice cream. As soon as it comes out of the ice cream maker, mix pieces of cookie dough into ice cream, if desired. Put ice cream into a container to harden and put ice cream bar sticks into it before it goes in the freezer.
   Wait until ice cream fully freezes.
   Temper chocolate (or maybe just melt it - see notes).
   Cut ice cream into bar like shapes.
   Once cut, place all but one of the ice cream bars back in the freezer so you're only working with one at a time.
   Dip in tempered or melted chocolate.
   If desired, sprinkle almonds (or other possible toppings) on outside.
   Immediately place back in the freezer to harden.

.. note::

    We have now made ice cream bars twice and both were ok, but not completely successful. The ice cream and cookie dough tasted great. Cutting the ice cream with a big knife worked better than putting it in popsicle molds (some came out, but others broke apart while trying to remove them). The hardest part was dipping the ice cream into the chocolate all at once so extra chocolate would nicely fall off. Both times, the chocolate ended up being too thick. We want to try just melting chocolate and having the nice crunch come from it being frozen instead of being properly tempered since it will make it a lot easier to quickly dip the entire bar in chocolate and have only a thin layer remain on it.
    The limiting factor for the amount of bars was the chocolate. The ice cream and cookie dough recipes linked here made more ice cream and cookie dough than there was chocolate. Thankfully both are delicious on their own!
