Lemon Sorbet
=============

.. ingredients::

   - 1.5 cups lemon juice
   - zest of 4 lemons
   - 2 cups water
   - 1.5 cups sugar

.. procedure::

   Zest and juice the lemons and let the zest sit in the juice for around 24 hours.
   Mix the water and the sugar in a pan and heat up until the sugar has entirely dissolved.  Take off the stove.
   Strain the lemon juice (so the zest gets strained out) and mix with the water/sugar mixture.
   Put the mixture in the fridge until completely cool.
   Churn in the ice cream maker on the sorbet setting until the noise changes and it looks like it's the right consistency.

.. note::

   We've made lemon sorbet with a variety of water/sugar/lemon juice ratios, and I'm still not quite sure what is ideal, but this one turned out well.  It probably depends some on how sweet the lemons are though.  I don't always let the zest sit in with the juice ahead of time (sometimes I just add the zest to the sorbet), but this method seems to work well, although it's not necessary if time is limited.
