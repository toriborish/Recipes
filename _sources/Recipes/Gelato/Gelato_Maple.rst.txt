Maple ice cream
=================

.. ingredients::

   - 1 cup maple syrup
   - 1.5 cups milk
   - 21.5 cups cream
   - 2 egg yolks

.. procedure::

   Put maple syrup in a pan and reduce it until it's around 1/2 - 3/4 of its initial volume.
   After that's done, heat up cream, milk, and egg yolks until it reaches 180 F.
   Take off heat and add in syrup.
   Chill in fridge overnight.
   Once cool, pour into ice cream maker and churn.

.. note::

   The first time I tried this, I used 1.5 cups of maple syrup, and it was too sweet for me. The texture was amazing though.
   Using less maple syrup still gives it a strong maple flavor and the sweetness isn't quite as overwhelming.
   The texture isn't quite as good, but it's still pretty good.
   I added toasted walnuts to this and it worked well.
   When reducing the syrup, I'm usually lazy, so I take it off after 10-20 minutes when it's only down to around 3/4 of the initial volume (approximately).
   I've used different mixes of skim and whole milk, and everything I've tried has worked well.
   This is delicious on it's own, and works well in coffee and as a waffle topping.
