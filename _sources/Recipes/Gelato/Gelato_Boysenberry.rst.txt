   - 245 g (1 cup) milk
   - 240 g (1 cup) cream
   - 1/2 cup plus a tiny bit sugar
   - 1 pint frozen boysenberries
   - juice half a lemon
   - ~1/2 tsp vanilla

.. procedure::

   Heat frozen boysenberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemon juice in a pan.
   Cook (stirring frequently) until mixture begins to thicken.  Cool.
   Heat milk, cream and a little bit of sugar until it is just boiling.
   Remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 20 minutes. Cool.
   Once both mixtures have fully cooled, mix together and add vanilla.

.. note::

   The consistency seemed pretty good (it was pretty smooth), but I wasn't quite happy with the flavor.  I think I would try adding more boysenberries (and maybe see if the boysenberry flavor is stronger if I don't cook them).  I would also alter the ratio of milk and cream so there's more milk and less cream.  The ice cream seemed too creamy to me, when I wanted the berry flavor to dominate.  I'm not sure what was the fat percentage of the milk I used for this, but I don't think it was skim milk, so maybe using 2/3 skim milk and 1/3 cream (like I do for mint ice cream) would be better.
