Apple Pie Ice Cream
=====================

.. ingredients::

   For the ice cream:

   - 400 g milk
   - 200 g cream
   - 2 egg yolks
   - ~90 g white sugar
   - ~20 g brown sugar
   - 1 tsp cinnamon (I think a little less would be better - see notes)

   For the mix-ins:

   - 2 apples, peeled and sliced into small pieces
   - just under 1/4 cup brown sugar
   - 3/4 tsp cinnamon
   - ~ 1 Tbsp butter
   - several graham crackers, mashed

.. procedure::

   Mix both kinds of sugar and cinnamon in a bowl on the side.
   Whisk milk, cream, and egg yolks in a pot.
   Heat to 40C, then add the sugar mixture.
   Heat to 82C, and maintain that temperature for 3 minutes.
   Cool down quickly in ice bath, let rest in the fridge overnight.

   Peel and cut up the apples (into pretty small pieces).
   Heat up butter in a frying pan.
   Add the apples, cinnamon, brown sugar, and mix.
   Cook for 10-20 minutes until apples are soft.
   Cool.

   Mash up a few graham crackers.

   Churn the ice cream.
   When done, put it onto a container and swirl in the apples and graham crackers.
   Freeze.


.. rubric:: References

I altered the cream gelato recipe for the base (see referenes on that recipe page) and figured everything else out after skimming over a lot of apple pie ice cream recipes online (they were all pretty similar and there wasn't one in particular that I followed).

.. note::

   This was a good first attempt, but I think it could be improved.  Without the apple mixture, the ice cream had about the right amount of cinnamon for me if I wanted to make cinnamon ice cream.  Since there was cinnamon with the apples, I would probably cut down on the amount of cinnamon in the ice cream (maybe to half of what I used?).  Also, I would make more ice cream (the fior di latte gelato recipe currently makes a better amount for our ice cream maker).  I had way too many apples for the amount of ice cream, although the left-over ones were a delicous snack.  I also had way too many graham cracker crumbs (I think I mashed up around 4 or 5 homemade ones).  I think I should have cut the apples even smaller (I cut them into thin slices and then cut the slices in one direction, but that left pieces that were ~1cm long in one direction and thin in the other two - they should be even smaller).  I'd also probably cook the apples even longer.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, but the primary flavor was cinnamon.  The apples and graham crackers do add an interesting texture.  The apples made the ice cream more solid/icy than I would like while trying to scoop the ice cream, but I'm not sure if there's anything I can do about that.  I ended up using skim milk since that's what we had at home, so maybe it would be a bit better if I had used whole milk instead?
