Raspberry sorbet
=====================

.. ingredients::

   - 650 g pureed (frozen) raspberries
   - 250 g water
   - 150 g sugar

.. procedure::

   Puree raspberries in food processor.
   They're easier to strain if they've had some time to defrost first.
   Create a simple syrup by heating up the water and sugar together in a pan until the sugar has fully dissolved.
   Mix the raspberries with the simple syrup.
   It's possible to strain at this point if the raspberries were previously too frozen to strain easily.  It's ok if some seed remain, but I was happy that I removed most of them.
   Churn in ice cream maker for 30 minutes on the sorbet setting.

.. note::

   I had tried making raspberry ice cream several times (replacing some of the milk/cream in the fior di latte recipe with pureed raspberries added at the end), and each time even as I increased the ratio of raspberries to milk/cream I just wanted it to be more raspberry-y.  I finally decided to ditch the cream/milk entirely and just go with sorbet.  This is amazing raspberry goodness that doesn't seem diluted in any way, like the ice cream did.  I've made this recipe several times now, with the approximate ratios above, but with slightly different amounts of raspberries (based on what I had) each time, and it always worked out well.

   One time I replaced the raspberries with boysenberries, and it was ok, but I definitely prefer it with raspberries.
   For some reason the boysenberry sorbet tasted like generic berry sorbet as opposed to boysenberries and the raspberry sorbet has always had a very strong raspberry flavor.
   Another time I replaced the raspberries with strawberries, and that worked well.
