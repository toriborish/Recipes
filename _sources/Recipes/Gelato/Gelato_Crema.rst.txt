.. note::

   The first time I made it, I used 4 egg yolks, and it was really rich and creamy.  The second time, I used only 2 egg yolks, and it was still quite delicious and creamy, so I'm probably going to stick with that. The first time I used 2% milk and the second I used whole milk, and both seemed to work well.  The second time I added around 1/2-1 tsp vanilla after I had let it cool down in the ice bath and before refrigerating. I think I could add more if I want it to have a vanilla flavor.  It might we worth trying either cooking to a slightly lower temperature or adding the egg later since this ice cream is very custardy.

   This works well to pour coffee over it (Carlo made an affogato with it).  It also works to add chunks of cookie dough for cookie dough ice cream.

   Carlo: made it with 3 eggs to split the difference, was good. Could increase the total yield though.
