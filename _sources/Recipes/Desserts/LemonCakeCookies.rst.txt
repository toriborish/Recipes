Lemon Cake Cookies
====================

.. ingredients::

   - 2 1/2 cups + 3 tbsp. flour
   - 3/4 tsp. baking powder
   - 3/4 tsp. baking soda
   - 1/2 tsp. salt
   - 9 tbsp. butter
   - 1 cup + 2 tbsp. sugar
   - 1 tbsp. grated lemon zest
   - 2 egg yolks
   - 1 whole egg
   - 1/4 cup sour cream

.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Beat butter, sugar, and lemon zest in a mixer for 2 minutes.
   Add egg yolks then the egg, and beat 10 seconds on high.
   Add the sour cream and beat for another 8 seconds.
   Fold in the dry ingredients first by hand and then with the mixer for 15 seconds.
   Bake about 12 minutes until firm to touch.

.. ingredients::

   Optional glaze:

   - 6 tbsp. butter
   - 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
   - 3 tbsp. lemon juice

.. procedure::

   Melt butter.
   Add lemon juice and sugar.
   Whisk until smooth.

.. note::

   This is an old family recipe of Tori's.  Growing up, I don't remember making the glaze.  I feel like I've tried it a couple of times without being too happy with the result, but I'll update this once I try it again.  The cookies are quite delicious even without anything.
