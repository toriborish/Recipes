Marble Brownies
==================

.. ingredients::

   For the brownie:

   - 1 1/2 oz. unsweetened chocolate
   - 1/2 cup butter
   - 3/4 cup water
   - 2 cups flour
   - 2 cups sugar
   - 1 tsp. baking soda
   - 2 eggs
   - 1/2 cup sour cream

   For the swirl:

   - 8 oz. softened cream cheese
   - 1/3 cup sugar
   - 1 egg

   Topping:

   - 6 oz. semisweet chocolate chips

.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Add butter, water, and chocolate to a saucepan, and bring to a boil (then remove from heat).
   In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, and baking soda.
   Add the chocolate mixture to the flour mixture.
   In a separate bowl, mix eggs and sour cream, and then add this to the chocolate mixture.
   Pour into a greased and floured 13 x 9 inch pan.
   Combine cream cheese and sugar, mixing until well blended. Mix in egg.
   Spoon cream cheese mixture over chocolate batter, and cut through batter several times with a spatula for the marble effect.
   Sprinkle with chocolate chips.
   Bake in a preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.

.. note::

   This is a family recipe of Tori's.  Sometimes we've made it with 2 oz. chocolate, 1 cup water, and 8 oz. of sour cream, and that's also delicious.
