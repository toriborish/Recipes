Boysenberry Lemon Almond Loaf Cake (or cupcakes)
================================================

.. makes:: 1 loaf cake or 12 cupcakes

.. ingredients::

   - 185 g butter
   - 1 cup sugar
   - zest of 1-2 lemons
   - 1/4 cup lemon juice
   - 1 tsp. vanilla
   - 2 eggs
   - 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
   - 1/2 cup almond flour
   - 1 tsp. baking powder
   - pinch of salt
   - around 30 boysenberries (fresh or frozen - not thawed)
   - 1 Tbsp. caster sugar


.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 355 F.
   Grease a 23 x 12 cm loaf pan or put liners in cupcake pan.
   Add the butter, sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice to a saucepan and heat until the butter is melted and the sugar has dissolved (it should not boil). Let cool.
   Add the eggs and vanilla. Mix well.
   Gently mix in the flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt.
   Put about half the batter in the cake pan or cupcake tins. If in a loaf pan, dot with half the berries. If making cupcakes, put one berry in each cupcake. Pour the remaining batter on top, fully covering the berries. Add another layer of berrries on top (or one per each cupcake) and sprinkle the extra caster sugar on top of the visible berries.
   Bake for 50-60 minutes for a loaf cake, less for cupcakes.
   Cool in the container.

.. note::

   When I cooked this in a loaf pan, I had trouble telling when it was fully cooked (it seemed both overdone and underdone at the same time). It was easy to tell with the cupcakes though.
   The recipe called for ground almonds, but I used almond flour since it easy to obtain and it worked fine.
