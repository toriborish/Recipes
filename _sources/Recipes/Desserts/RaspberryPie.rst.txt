Raspberry Pie
====================

.. ingredients::

   For the pie crust:

   - 1 1/4 cups flour
   - 1/4 tsp. salt
   - 1/3 cup butter
   - 4-5 tbsp. cold water

   For the filling:

   - 6 cups raspberries
   - 1/2 cup white sugar
   - 6+ tbsp. cornstarch (up to 7-8 if using frozen berries)

   For the whipped cream:

   - 3/4 pint whipping cream
   - 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
   - 2-3 tbsp. powdered sugar

.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Combine flour and salt and cut butter in to mixture.
   Mix with hands until there are no large pieces of butter left.
   Add cold water a couple tablespoons at a time until the dough is just sticky enough to work with (knead it as little as possible).
   On a floured surface, roll out the dough to be a 12 inch diameter circle.
   Place it in the pie tin and poke a few small holes in both the bottom and sides with a fork so it won't bubble while cooking.
   Bake in the oven at 450 F for 8-10 minutes (until it is just turning golden).

   Smash the berries in a saucepan.
   Mix the sugar and cornstarch and add that to the berries.
   Bring to a boil (the mixture will thicken and start to become clearer).
   Cook for 3-4 additional minutes and transfer to pie crust (that has already cooled down).
   Let cool and refrigerate.

   Whip cream and gradually add vanilla and sugar once it's almost done.  This needs to be whipped well in order to keep its shape for several days.
   Spread whipped cream on top of raspberry layer.
   Enjoy!

.. note::

   This is a family recipe of Tori's.  You can't go wrong with raspberries and cream.  It's better with fresh raspberries, but frozen work well too.  The crust recipe here isn't my favorite, but you can easily replace it with a better one.
