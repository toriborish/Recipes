Chocolate Chip Cookies
=======================

.. ingredients::

   - 1 cup butter
   - just under 1 cup brown sugar
   - 1/3-1/2 cup white sugar
   - 2 eggs
   - 1 tsp. vanilla
   - around 2 cups flour
   - 1 tsp. baking soda
   - semi-sweet chocolate chips

.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Mix the butter with both kinds of sugar.
   Add eggs and vanilla.
   Mix flour and baking soda together and add them to the other mixture.
   Add however many chocolate chips you want.
   Bake for 8-12 minutes.

.. note::

   Tori has been making this since she was little.  The dough tastes amazing, and it works well to shape it into balls and leave it in the freezer to snack on later.  This recipe theoretically makes a little over two dozen medium sized cookies, but that depends on how much sampling occurs.
