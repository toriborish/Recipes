Cinnamon Rolls
===============

.. ingredients::

   For the rolls:

   - 1 cup warm milk (105-110 degrees F)
   - 1/4 ounce active dry yeast (1 packet)
   - 1/2 cup white sugar
   - 1/3 cup butter, melted
   - 1 tsp. salt
   - 2 eggs
   - 4 cups flour

   For the filling:

   - around 1/3 cup softened butter
   - 1/2 cup brown sugar
   - 2 1/2 tbsp. ground cinnamon

   For the icing:

   - 2 tsp. softened butter
   - 6 oz. cream cheese
   - 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar
   - 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract


.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
   For the rolls, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl.  Let sit for a few minutes.
   Add the sugar, butter, salt, eggs, and flour and mix well.
   Knead the dough into a large ball, put into a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
   Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is around 21 x 16 x 1/4 inches.
   For the filling, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.
   Spread the softened butter and then the cinnamon mixture evenly over the dough.
   Roll the dough (either way, depending on how big you want the cinnamon rolls to be) and cut it into about 1 3/4 inch slices.
   Place these on a greased baking sheet so they have room to expand but they will still run into each other and cause the edges to be gooey.
   Bake in a preheated oven for about 10 minutes or until they are light brown on top.
   While the rolls bake, combine the icing ingredients and beat well with an electric mixer until fluffy.
   When the rolls come out of the oven, coat each generously with icing.
