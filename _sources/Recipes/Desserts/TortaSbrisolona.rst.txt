Torta Sbrisolona
=====================

.. ingredients::

   - 200 AP flour
   - 100 g fine cornmeal
   - 200 g almonds
   - 2 egg yolks
   - 170g sugar
   - 200 g butter (softened)
   - zest of one lemon
   - 1 tsp vanilla
   - pinch of salt

.. procedure::

   In a food processor, pulse the almonds, sugar and cornmeal until they form a coarse powder.
   Mix the result with the AP flour.
   Add in the yolks, vanilla, salt and lemon zest.
   Add the butter, and mix until you get a more or less homogeneous result.
   If you want to, you can add 30 g or so of roughly chopped almonds to the mix.
   Press the mixture into a 2cm high disk, and put in the freezer for about 30 minutes.

   Line a 10 inch cake pan with parchment paper and butter.
   Crumble the semi frozen mixture into the pan, without pressing it.
   Top with a few whole almonds and a sprinkle of sugar.
   Bake covered for 40 minutes in a 350 F oven. If needed, uncover and bake for 5-10 minutes more.

.. note::

   This is an amazing cake for tea. Try to use fine cornmeal (I only had the coarse one and it is slightly annoying).
