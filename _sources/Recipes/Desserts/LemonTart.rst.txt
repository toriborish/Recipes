Lemon Tart
===========

.. makes:: 1 9-inch tart (or several smaller tarts)

.. ingredients::

   For the crust (enough for 2 tarts):

   - 1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp. butter at room temperature
   - 1/3 cup sugar
   - 1 egg at room temperature
   - 1 3/4 cups (500 g) flour

   For the filling:

   - 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp lemon juice
   - 3 eggs
   - 1 egg yolk
   - 1/2 cup sugar
   - ~4-5 Tbsp butter

   Optional topping:

   - Whipped cream (cream, powdered sugar, vanilla)

.. procedure::

    Combine butter and sugar and mix in stand mixer. Add in egg and mix well. Add flour and beat on low until just mixed.
    Divide into two balls of equal size and shape each into a disk 1/2 inch thick. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours.
    Roll dough out until 1/8 inch thick on a slightly floured surface. Trasnfer dough to pan without stretching it out. Trim so it's level with the sides of the pan. Refridgerate or freeze for 15 minutes.
    Preheat oven to 325 Fahrenheit. Make holds in the bottom of the tart with a fork. Bake in oven for 12-15 minutes until golden brown.

    For filling:
    Mix lemon juice, eggs, egg yolk, and sugar in a pan. Whisk ingredients together while heating until it reaches 180 F.
    Pour into an immersion blender. Add in butter 1 Tbsp at a time until the appropriate taste is reached.
    More butter will make it creamier but also cut down on the lemon flavor.
    Pour filling into cooled tart shell.
    Cool.

    If desired, top with whipped cream.

.. note::

    This works as a large tart or as smaller ones. Sometimes I've been very happy with this tart crust, but I'm still on a quest for my optimal tart crust.
    I've used this recipe with lilikoi as well, and that works well.
