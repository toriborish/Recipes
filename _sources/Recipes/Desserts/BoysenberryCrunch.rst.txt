Boysenberry Crunch
====================

.. ingredients::

   For the crust:

   - 2 cups flour
   - 1 cup rolled oats
   - 1 cup brown sugar
   - 1 cup butter (cool, but not completely frozen)

   For the filling:

   - 7-8 cups boysenberries
   - 1 cup sugar
   - 7 Tbsp. cornstarch (more if using frozen berries)
   - 1/2 cup water

.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
   In a mixing bowl, combine flour, oats, and brown sugar.
   Cut butter into mixture until it resembles fine crumbs (this is easiest to do with your hands).
   Press about half of this into the bottom of a 13 x 9 inch baking pan (and save the other half for the top).
   In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and cornstarch.
   Add the water and cook over medium heat stirring constantly until thickened and clear (wait for a couple of minutes after it boils).
   Remove from heat and add about 2/3 of the berries, mixing as little as possible until completely mixed.
   Pour this mixture on top of the flour mixture in the pan.
   Top with the rest of the berries.
   Add the rest of the flour mixture and spread evenly over the top.
   Bake in preheated over for 10 minutes then turn the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for 40 minutes longer.  It should be golden on top with berry juice bubbling up around the edges.

.. note::

   This is a family recipe of Tori's from one of the cookbooks (I'll try to remember which one and add it here).  This works with brozen boysenberries, but it's better with fresh ones.  It also works with blackberries.
