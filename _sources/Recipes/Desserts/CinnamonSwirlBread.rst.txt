Cinnamon Swirl Bread
=====================

.. ingredients::

   For the bread:

   - 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F, feels warm but not hot)
   - 1 packet (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
   - 1/3 cup white sugar
   - 1 tsp. salt
   - 2 tbsp. vegetable or canola oil
   - 3 cups flour

   For the filling:

   - 3 tbsp. butter, softened but not melted
   - about 1/3 cup sugar
   - 1-2 tsp. cinnamon
   - optional: about 1/3 cup raisins

.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water, and then stir in yeast.
   Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.
   Mix salt and oil into the yeast.
   Mix in flour one cup at a time.
   Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, about 8 to 10 minutes.
   Place in a well-oiled bowl, turn dough to coat, and cover with a damp cloth.
   Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
   Punch the dough down, and knead for a minute or two.
   Roll the dough out into a rectangle, approximately 9 x 15 inches.
   Spread the softened butter all over the surface, then sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar all over the buttered surface, and then the raisins.
   Roll up from short end (so the finished roll is 9 inches long), and place into a well-oiled 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.
   Allow to rise for around 30-40 minutes.
   Bake for 30 minutes.

This recipe comes from Sonia.  She gave it to Tori as thanks for driving her to a trailhead one time while at Williams.

.. note::

   I've always made it without raisins, and it's a great snack food (or good as french toast).
