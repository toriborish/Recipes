Apple Pie
==============

.. ingredients::

   For the pie crust:

   - 2 cups flour
   - 1/2 tsp. salt
   - 12 tbsp. butter
   - 6-8 tbsp. cold water

   For the filling:

   - 6 peeled, cored, and sliced apples
   - 3/4 cup white sugar
   - 2 tbsp. flour
   - 1 tsp. ground cinnamon
   - (optional: 1/8 tsp. nutmeg)

.. procedure::

   Combine flour and salt and cut butter in to mixture.
   Mix with hands until there are no large pieces of butter left.
   Add cold water a couple tablespoons at a time until the dough is just sticky enough to work with (knead it as little as possible).
   Divide dough into two not-quite-equal pieces.
   On a floured surface, roll out both parts individually until they are about 1/8 inch thick.
   Place the larger one in the bottom of a pie tine and poke small holes in it with a fork.

   In a separate bowl, mix sugar, flour, and cinnamon.
   Pour this over the sliced apples.
   Fill the pie crust with the apple mixture.
   Cover the apples with the rest of the pie crust dough (either as a single sheet with slits cut into it or as a lattice).
   Place in a preheated oven and bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes.  Turn temperature down to 275-300 degrees Fahrenheit and bake another 40-50 minutes or until crust is golden brown and apples are tender.
   Let cool and serve.

.. note::

   I rarely add nutmeg, but you could.  This still isn't my favorite pie crust recipe, but it works.  I really like the way lattice pie crusts look, but it requires slightly more pie crust than just a layer on top.
