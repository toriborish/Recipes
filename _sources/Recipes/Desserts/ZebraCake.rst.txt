Zebra Cake
============================

.. makes:: 1-layer 9-inch round cake

.. ingredients::
   - 298 g granulated sugar
   - 4 large eggs
   - 227 g milk
   - 149 g vegetable oil
   - 1 Tbsp. vanilla
   - 240 g all-purpose flour
   - 2 tsp. baking powder
   - pinch salt
   - 16 g Dutch-process cocoa powder
   - 3/4 tsp. espresso powder (optional)

.. procedure::

    Prehead the oven to 350 F.
    Grease a cake pan and put parchment paper on the bottom.
    Beat sugar and eggs with mixer until lightened, around 2 minutes.
    Add in the oil, milk, and vanilla. Beat on low until smooth.
    In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt. 
    Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix on medium for 1-2 minutes until batter is smooth.
    Remove 2 cups of the batter and put in another bowl. Sift the cocoa and espresso powders over this batter and mix. This will be the chocolate batter and the remaining part is the vanilla batter.
    Add around 3 Tbsp. of the vanilla batter to the center of the cake pan. Then continue to alternate adding 3 Tbsp of chocolate and vanilla batters on top at the center of the cake pan until you finish the cake batter. This method will cause the batter to look like a bulls-eye and you will get rings of the two batters.
    Bake for 35-40 minutes.
    Cool in pan for 10 minutes then finish cooking on a wire rack.
    You can eat the cake on its own or with a cream cheese frosting.

.. note::

    The way this recipe works as written above, the chocolate batter is thicker than the vanilla batter, which made the layering a little uneven. The second time we made this recipe, we removed a little flour initially so we could add a comparable amount of extra flour to the vanilla batter as cocoa/espresso to the chocolate batter to make them have the same consistency. That seemed to work better. I can update the amounts here after I do it again.
