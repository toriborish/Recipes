Lava Cake
==========

.. ingredients::

   - 220 grams dark chocolate (64%)
   - 8 squares of the same chocolate
   - 220 grams butter
   - 160 grams white sugar
   - 120 grams flour
   - 4 eggs

.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
   In a double boiler, slowly melt the chocolate and then add in the butter.
   Take away from heat and let cool.
   Beat eggs and sugar just to the point that they have whitened.
   Add flour into egg mixture.
   Add egg/flour mixture to the chocolate.
   Prepare molds: grease with butter and then a layer of cocoa powder so the cake won't stick.
   Fill molds halfway, place a squre of chocolate in the middle, then finish filling.
   Cook 7-10 minutes until the outer edge of the cake has cooked, but it is still nice and gooey in the center.
