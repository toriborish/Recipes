Chocolate Mousse
=================

.. ingredients::

   - 1 pound semisweet chocolate, broken into smaller pieces
   - 1 1/2 cups whipping cream
   - 6 egg whites

.. procedure::

   In the top of a double boiler over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring intermittently until just melted.
   While the chocolate is melting, place the egg whites in a clean dry bowl and whip them with an electric mixer until they hold soft peaks.
   When the chocolate is melted, stir in 1/2 cup of the whipping cream.
   Fold in the whipped egg whites, being careful to retain as much of their volume as possible.
   Whip the remaining 1 cup of cream until it is quite firm, and fold it carefully into the chocolate mixture.
   Pour into pretty glasses and chill for several hours.
   You may optionally top with extra whipped cream, mint leaves, raspberries, or other garnishes before serving.
