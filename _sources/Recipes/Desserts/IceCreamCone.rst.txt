Ice Cream Cone
=====================

I tried two recipes as my first attempt at making ice cream cones.  See notes below.  These need to be iterated on.

Recipe 1
-----------

.. ingredients::

   - 1/2 cup sugar
   - 1 egg
   - 2 tbsp melted and cooled butter
   - 1 tsp vanilla
   - 1/4 cup milk
   - 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

.. procedure::

   Preheat over to 300 deg F.
   Beat the egg and sugar in a bowl until it is thickened and pale yellow.
   Add the butter, vanilla, and milk.
   Add in the flour.

   Put parchment paper or a silicon mat on a cookie sheet.
   Put 1.5 tbsp batter onto the cookie sheet and spread out until it covers a 6 inch circle.
   Repeat until cookie sheet is full.
   Bake for around 10-15 minutes until lightly browned.
   Remove the cookies one at a time and immediately roll into a cone shape.

.. note::

   One recipe book suggested parchment paper instead of the silicon mat, so I started with that; however it ended up having creases in it which split the cones in half while they were still in the oven.
   I then switched over to the silicon mat, and this recipe was sticking a little bit, but it was much more even.
   A fish spatula seemed to be the best instrument to remove the cookies from the tray before rolling them.
   Using what I learned when I made fortune cookies when I was younger, I used a pair of small cotton gloves to handle the hot cookies as I shaped them, and it worked well.
   This would be a lot easier with the appropriate cone mold.
   It would also be fun to get a waffle cone maker at some point.
   Without ice cream inside the cones, Carlo liked this recipe better than the other because it was sweet and tasted like what he thinks cones should taste like.  However, once there was ice cream inside, he said that maybe it was too sweet and crunchy, and he prefered the other one.

Recipe 2
----------

.. ingredients::

   - 70 ml (+ more added later) egg whites (~ 2 eggs)
   - 60 g sugar
   - 1/2 tsp vanilla
   - 90 g flour
   - 2 tbsp melted and cooled butter

.. procedure::

   Preheat over to 350 deg F.
   Mix together egg whites, sugar, and vanilla.
   Add half the flour, then add in the butter, and then the rest of the flour, beating until smooth.

   Put parchment paper or a silicon mat on a cookie sheet.
   Put 2 tbsp batter onto the cookie sheet and spread out until it covers a 6 inch circle.
   Repeat until cookie sheet is full.
   Bake for 10-15 minutes until lightly browned.
   Remove the cookies one at a time and immediately roll into a cone shape.

.. note::

   (See notes from previous recipe).
   I used only the silicon mat for these, and they all came off easily.
   This recipe calls for slightly more batter per cone, and I found the 2 tbsp in this recipe to work well.
   Following the recipe as it's written, the batter ended up really thick and hard to spread.
   The first batch of this recipe was way to clumpy and they cracked as I was rolling them.
   I then added some more egg whites to the remaining batter until it was the consistency of the previous recipe and it spread well.  Those turned out nice and smooth.
   If I make these again, I would either cut down on the flour, or add additional egg whites or milk at the beginning.
   Carlo thought these were too doughy without ice cream, but liked them when they had ice cream inside.
   Tori liked that these were less sweet.  They were a little thick/doughy at a couple of places in the middle, but that could probably be altered by making the dough thinner before baking.
   Current plan for next time: make a combo of the recipes- probably more like this one, but add extra milk to thin it down to the right (easily spreadable) consistency.
