Cassie's Lemon Bars
===================

.. ingredients::

   - 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
   - 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
   - 1/2 cup butter, softened
   - 4 eggs
   - 1 1/2 cups white sugar
   - 1/2 cup lemon juice
   - 1 tablespoon lemon zest

.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
   Mix 1 cups of flour and confectioner's sugar together. Cut in the butter or margarine.
   Mix well until the dough resembles pie dough consistency. Press the dough into an 8x8 inch baking pan.
   Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
   Beat together eggs, sugar, 4 tablespoons flour, lemon juice and lemon rind for at least 1 minute. Pour the mixture over the baked crust.
   Bake the bars another 20 minutes, or until the lemon topping has set. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar when cooled.

.. note::

   (From Tori) Although this recipe initially called for twice as much crust, that had way too high of a crust to filling ratio, 
   so I edited the recipe and the ratio is better now.
   If you want to bake this in a 9 x 13 pan, you could double the current version of this recipe.
