.. procedure::

   For double chocolate cookies:
   Preheat oven to 350 F.
   Cream butter and both sugars in a mixer.
   Add egg and vanilla and mix.
   In a separate bowl, mix flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
   Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients.
   Add chocolate chips.
   Refrigerate dough for 15-20 minutes.
   Form balls of cookie dough (~1.5-2 Tbsp. each) and place on cookie tray with parchment paper or a silcon baking mat.
   Bake for 8-10 minutes.
   Let cookies set on baking tray for 2 minutes before moving off tray to cooling rack.

   For pumpkin cookies:
   Preheat oven to 350 F.
   Line two baking trays with parchment paper or silicon baking mats.
   Dry out the pumpkin by spreading it on a plate and lightly pressing with a paper towel to absorb the liquid. A new paper towel should be applied to the pumpkin at least 4 more times.
   Mix the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin pie spice.
   In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar on high for 1-2 minutes.
   Add the egg yolks and vanilla and mix on medium for 1-2 minutes.
   Add the pumpkin and mix on medium-low until combined.
   Add the dry ingredients and mix on low until just combined.
   Make dough balls and roll them in a mix of the extra sugar and pie spice. Place on cookie tray.
   Bake for 12-14 minutes.
   Cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.

   For eyes:
   Beat egg whites in a large bowl at high speed until foamy.
   Gradually add sugar and continue beating on high until thick.
   Can add water if too thick or more sugar if too thin.
   Put in a piping back and make dots of white icing on a parchment-paper lined cookie tray. (The little point in the middle after piping should settle into the eye if it's the right consistency.) Experiment until you get the right size and consistency.
   Add black food coloring to the remaining icing and put in a piping bag. Once the surface of the white icing has dried, pipe a smaller black dot in the center of the white dots.
   Let sit out for around 24 hours to fully dry/harden. The eyes should come off parchment paper easily when they are dry.

   Assembly for spider cookies:
   Bake cookies (pumpkin or any other light-ish cookie, see options in notes below).
   If the chocolate pieces you're using for the bodies has oxidized and you want it to melt a little to look better, put a chocolate disk/feve in the center of each cookie as soon as it is removed from the oven. That will let it melt just a tiny bit so it attaches firmly to the cookie and looks smooth. If you are using some kind of chocolate/candy that already looks good, you could instead add it once the cookie has cooled using a little melted chocoalte to attach it.
   Once the cookie is fully cool, melt other chocolate and pipe legs on to the spiders.
   Add eyes using a little bit of melted chocolate as an adhesive.

   Assembly for ghost cookies:
   Bake cookies (see above for double chocolate cookie recipe, but any other type of dark cookie would work too) and let cool at least 15 minutes.
   Melt white chocolate and mix in cocoa butter so it's a consistency that will spread/pour easily.
   Dip the bottom of a marshmallow in the white chocolate and use to stick to cookie.
   Pour white chocolate mixture over mashmallow and use knife/spatula to help ensure even spreading and that it extends beyond the marshmallow the way you want.
   Once the white chocolate has dried, pipe eyes onto the ghosts using melted dark chocolate or some kind of black frosting.

   Assembly for eye cookies:
   Bake cookies (the double chocolate ones work well, but you could probably put the eyes on any other type of cookie too) and let cool.
   Attach the eyes to the cookies (with a tiny bit of melted chocolate, the frosting from the eyes, etc.) in whatever pattern you like. It looks cool if you have eyes of difference sizes.

.. note::

    I have made these several different years and there are many possible variations. I just listed a few here. I think I made molasses or ginger cookies one year and apple cider cookies another year (trying to be fall themed) instead of the pumpkin cookies. Be creative and have fun!
