   - ~1/4 tsp. salt
   - 2 tsp. vanilla

   - 4 egg whites + 1 egg (at room temperature)
   - 376 grams cake flour
   - 300 grams whole milk

   For the curd:

   For the swiss meringue buttercream:

   - 2 sticks butter (at room temperature)
   - 3 egg whites
   - 248 grams fine sugar
   - pinch salt


.. procedure::

    You can make the curd and compote ahead of time.

    For the curd:
    I tried a couple options for when to add the mint, and I don't remember what I liked best, but here is one option (alternatively, could try adding mint at end).
    Put the sugar and mint leaves in a food processor and blend.
    Mix this sugar/mint with lemon juice, eggs, and egg yolk in a pan. Whisk ingredients while heating until it reaches 180 F. Pour into an immersion blender and add in butter 1 Tbsp. at a time until the appropate taste is reached. Cool.

    For the compote:
    Strain half the berries, leave the other half unstrained.
    Mix cornstarch with sugar.
    Combine cornstarch and sugar mixture with berries and optional lemon juice in a saucepan. 
    Cook for a little while.

    For the cake:
    Preheat oven to 340 F. 
    Grease 2 9-inch cake pans and line with parchment paper.
    In a stand mixer, beat the butter, sugar and oil on medium speed for 2-3 minutes (until it lightens).
    Add the baking powder, salt, vanilla, and lemon zest and beat.
    Add the egg and egg whites a little at a time. Beat until fluffy.
    Alternate adding the flour (divided into three parts) and the milk.
    Divide evenly into two cake pans.
    Bake for around 28 minutes.
    Let cool in pans for 10 minutes then put onto cooling rack to finish cooling.

    For the frosting:
    Briefly mix egg whites, sugar, and salt in stand mixer bowl.
    Place bowl over a saucepan of simmering water.
    Whisk constantly until it heats up to 161 F.
    Remove from the heat and attach to stand mixer with the whisk attachment.
    Beat until stiff.
    While the mixer is running, add a few tablespoons of butter at a time.
    Keep mixing until the frosting has emulsified.

.. note::

    I made this for the JILA Bake-Off in spring 2023. I had issues with scaling, so I think the amounts here will work well, but I haven't tried exactly this ratio of cake to filling/frosting. Also, some of my notes got deleted, so the amounts may need to be adjusted a bit.
    I would try less butter for the same amount of eggs for the frosting, probably around 1.5 sticks of butter. You need to have patience with the frosting. It will eventually emulsify; just keep blending.
    For this recipe, I used some high alittude baking tips, so this is optimized for Boulder.
    If you don't have extra-fine sugar for the frosting, you can put regular granulated sugar in a blender (I used the Magic Bullet).
    I didn't write assembly instructions, but it would be nice if you could get both the curd and the berry compote on each layer. Either see if they can be layered on top of each other, or cut the cakes in half so there are four short layers and then alternate curd with compote so you get two of each.
