Lilikoi (Passion Fruit) Curd
=================================

.. makes:: enough for 1 9-inch tart

.. ingredients::

   - 1/2 cup lilikoi juice
   - 50 g butter, melted
   - ~1/3 cup sugar
   - 1 egg, whisked
   - cornstarch (possibly around 1.5-2 Tbsp?)

.. procedure::

   Mix the sugar with a little cornstarch in a bowl on the side.  Melt the butter in a saucepan and add in the sugar/cornstarch and lilikoi juice over low heat.
   As soon as the sugar has dissolved (while the mixture isn't too hot yet), add the egg.
   Continuously mix until boiling.
   Remove from heat and let cool.
   Use over a cheesecake or tart crust or cake or eat on it's own.
   Refrigerate before serving.

.. note::

   I used this curd for my first lilikoi cheesecake tart and a raspbery/lilikoi cake, but have since used Tartine's lemon curd recipt replacing the lemon with lilkoi (see Lemon Tart recipe). Both are good - I should do a direct comparison sometime.
   For this one, I used lilikoi juice instead of pulp, so I needed to add extra cornstarch to the topping since it didn't thicken enough on it's own.  I'm not sure exactly how much I added since I did it after the fact (mixed in with a little of the topping to avoid clumps).  
   It tasted great and ended up being the consistency I wanted, so I think using juice works well.
   The biggest mistake I made was that I added the egg when the lilikoi mixture was too hot, so a little bit of the egg scrambled and I had to remove it.  Avoid that in the future, probably by using a thermometer.
