Lemon Pound Cake
=================

.. ingredients::

   For the cake:

   - 3 cups sifted cake flour
   - 2 cups white sugar
   - 1 tsp. baking powder
   - 1 1/2 cups softened salted butter
   - 1/3 cup buttermilk (or a few tbsp. powdered buttermilk + 1/3 cup lemon juice)
   - 6 large eggs
   - 2 tsp. lemon juice
   - 1 tbsp. grated lemon zest (from 2 medium lemons)

   For the glaze:

   - 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
   - 1/4 cup white sugar

.. procedure::

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
   In a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed, blend flour, sugar, and baking powder (and powdered buttermilk if using it in powdered form).
   Add butter, buttermilk, and 3 eggs, and beat on low until moistened.
   Increase speed to high and beat for 2 minutes.
   Add lemon juice and lemon zest, and blend at medium speed.
   Add the 3 remaining eggs one at a time, beating at high speed for seconds after each addition.
   Pour into greased tube bundt pan.
   Bake for 50-60 minutes in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean (it should be pretty brown).
   While cake is baking, put lemon juice and sugar in a small saucepan for glaze.
   With a tootpick, insert holes in the surface of the cake and pour most of the glaze over this (if you have a syringe, that works much better for injecting the glaze inside the cake).
   Cool in pan for a little while then invert onto a cooling rack.
   You can optionally brush the top of the cake with the remaining glaze (but it often doesn't soak in well there), or leave it on the side for dipping.
   Serve at room temperature.

.. note::

   This is an old family recipe of Tori's.  We usually used powdered buttermilk (however much was needed to make 1/3 cup) but replaced the 1/3 cup water that went with that with lemon juice.  Using a syringe to inject the glaze is the superior strategy - make sure the syringe doesn't get plugged with any pulp or zest.  We sometimes used 5 eggs instead of 6 and it tasted pretty similar.
