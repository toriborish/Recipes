Kue Nastar (Indonesian Pineapple Cookies)
==========================================

.. ingredients::

   For pineapple jam:

   - 550 grams pineapple chunks (from 1 large fresh, peeled, and cored pineapple)
   - 75 grams sugar

   For pastry:

   - 254 grams all-purpose unbleached flour
   - 65 grams confectioner's sugar
   - 1/4 tsp salt
   - 4 oz unsalted butter, cut into large chunks
   - zest 1 large orange
   - 2 egg yolks
   - 2 tbsp milk

   For egg wash:

   - 1 egg wash
   - 1 tsp milk

   Additional:

   - 28-29 cloves (1 per cookie)

.. procedure::

   Puree pineapple chunks using food processor or a blender.
   Transfer to sauce pan, add sugar, then cook on medium heat until all liquid has evaporated.
   Lower the heat to low, continue to cook until it has thickened and is a little drier than the consistency of regular jam.
   Remove from heat, cool completely.

   Place pastry ingredients in a food processor, pulse for a few seconds until it is starting to come together.

   Take about 16 grams of dough, flatten it, place 6 grams of pineapple jam in the center, and enclose the filling, forming into a round ball.
   Place the ball on a cookie sheet.
   Repeat with the rest of the dough (the cookies can be pretty close together since they don't expand much in the oven).
   Cover the sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour (or overnight).

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
   In a small bowl, whisk the yolk and milk together for the egg wash.
   Brush each cookie with egg wash, then top with a clove (pushing the rounded part in a little so the pointy end sticks straight up).
   Bake in the center of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden to your liking.
   Cool completely before serving.

.. note::

   The pineapple jam stores really well in the freezer.
   Last time I did this, I made jam from one pineapple, and it lasted me through several batches of cookies.
   Making the jam is the most time intensive part.
   I may have skipped the refrigerate step some of the times I've made these (I don't remember doing it, but it's been a while).
